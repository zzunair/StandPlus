<div>"Instead of explaining how I've been impacted, I want to take this chance to share my story about the "why" behind my job, the "why" behind the dream.</div>
<div>     </div>
<div>At 16 I learned I was infertile. Or...missing most of my reproductive organs. At this point in my life, I was dreaming of my future: my wedding, husband, career, children, &amp; even my dog. When I was told I could never carry my own child, all my plans changed &amp; instead became months of tears, appointments, &amp; questions.</div>
<div>     </div>
<div>I had maternal instincts at a young age &amp; started nannying when I was 12. I took every certification class &amp; wanted to work as a nurse in pediatrics. After my diagnosis, I grew to resent many women for their seemingly normal bodies. Due to this, my job as a nanny &amp; what I thought was my dream career disappeared quickly. </div>
<div>     </div>
<div>After 2 years of grief, I realized through the pain paired with definite infertility, I’ve become a person with the understanding &amp; loving nature needed to pursue my new dream career: a labor &amp; delivery nurse. It made me realize I could be an amazing nurse for both an excited or grieving parent. I want to live my life helping those with the gift of bearing children, even though I wasn’t given that gift. I don’t want to miss out on the beautiful things new life has to offer, even if science has told me I’m unable to do it myself.</div>
<div>     </div>
<div>When I was diagnosed, I would’ve told you there’s nothing positive about my condition. Four years later, it’s led me through many life choices &amp; has expanded my view on topics from religion to mental health. Yes, infertility has completely changed me &amp; made me into a different person, but it will never define me. With or without a uterus, I am Tyler Bedley, and I will be one fantastic nurse."</div></div></div>
